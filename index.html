		<h1>HOVERCRAFT CROSSING MARKS A NEW ERA IN TRANSPORT</h1>

		<h3>1959, Calais</h3>

		<p>
		 A revolutionary new form of transport which can operate on sea and land has crossed the English Channel. The Hovercraft, which has been described as a cross between an aircraft, a boat and a land vehicle, was invented by boat-builder Mr Christopher Cockerell, and can reach speeds of 25-knots.
		<br>
		<br>
		Mr Cockerell said that in fine weather, the craft can cross the Channel in as little as twenty minutes.
		Dubbed a "man-made flying saucer", the hovercraft is propelled on a cushion of air created by its own fan power. It therefore hovers just above the waves at sea and avoids any irregular surfaces on land.
		<br>
		<br>
		Mr Cockerell, from Lowestoft, said he first came up with the idea when he was thinking how to make a boat go faster by reducing the amount of friction caused when it travels through the water. The SRN-1, an experimental model, is 29 feet long and 24 feet wide and weighs 6,600lb.
		</br>
		<br>
		Following today's crossing of the SRN-1 hovercraft, Mr Cockerell announced he is now planning a prototype up to ten times as big and weighing 40 tons.

  		<h1>THIEVING VICAR ON THE RUN</h1>
  		<h3>2015, London</h3>
  		<p>
    	 A Church of England vicar has gone on the run as he was convicted of pocketing thousands of pounds of cash handed over as fees for weddings, funerals and graveyard memorials.
    	</p>
    	<p>
		Simon Reynolds, 50, went out for lunch and did not come back afterwards, an official at Sheffield Crown Court said on Thursday. The jury later came back and convicted him on all charges, she said.
		Reynolds, of Farnham, Surrey, was accused of keeping fees handed over to him by bereaved families and engaged couples when he was priest-in-charge of All Saints Church in Darton, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire.
		</p>
		<p>
		He should have handed over the money - estimated to total around £24,000 - to the diocese and the parochial church council, the court heard. South Yorkshire Police said a warrant had been issued for Reynolds' arrest and officers were actively searching for him. It said in a statement that he had been convicted of four counts of theft, despite his absence at court. He had appeared on Thursday morning before the jury was sent out by the judge to deliberate on their verdict, but failed to attend court on Thursday afternoon.

    	<h1>IT’S A GIRL</h1>
    	<h3>1978, Oldham</h3>
    	<p>
    	Medical history has been made as the first test-tube baby is born – and a mother’s dream comes true. Mrs Lesley Brown, the world’s first test-tube mother, gave birth to a baby girl at Oldham General Hospital, Lancashire, last night after a caesarean section delivery. The historic birth took place before midnight. The baby weighed in at 5lb 12 ozs. Medical staff said later that the condition of both mother and daughter were ‘excellent’.
    	<br>
    	<br>
		The birth was slightly premature – it was due on August 4. Last week Mrs Brown (32) was found to be suffering from toxemia, a mild form of blood poisoning, and there was speculation that her gynaecologist, Mr Patrick Steptoe, would hasten the birth to avoid complications.
		<br>
		<br>
		The toxaemia followed a month long crisis for Mr Steptoe when Mrs Brown was found to be suffering from a hormone deficiency which threatened to starve the unborn baby of oxygen. When Mrs Brown was presented with her long-waited child today it was not the first time she had seen her. Earlier this month she saw the fully-formed baby in her womb with the help of an ultrasonic scanner.
		<br>
		<br>
		The test-tube baby breakthrough is the product of the research Mr Steptoe, whose unit s at Oldham, and a Cambridge physiologist, Dr Robert Smith.

 		<h1>THE TELEGRAPH AGE DAWNS</h1>
 		<h3>1837, London.</h3>
 		<p>
 		We have this week to publish, a report of a new invention in the field of Electrical Communication. 
 		<br>
 		<br>
 		A message has been Conveyed between Euston and Camden Town, by the properties peculiar to copper wire when Electrified. Mr William Cooke of Farnham and Mr Charles Wheatstone of Gloucester, partners in business and in patent, co-credited with the Invention of this new method of conveyance, said the successful exhibition of their method, which is said to be an improvement upon previous attempts, heralds the advent of a new era in the delivery of news.
 		<br>
 		<br>
 		The invention was said to been inspired by the need “for improvements in giving signals and sounding alarms in distant places by means of electric currents transmitted through electric circuits” in matters of commercial enterprise.
